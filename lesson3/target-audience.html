        <p>As an ambassador for the Chamber and local business owner, it is an honor to be part of this community. The
            Chamber works so hard to ensure that every member is appreciated and promoted. Ribbon cuttings, new member
            breakfast, Business After Hours, Surprise Patrol & Lunch Mob drop-ins with goodiesâ€”these community
            representatives do it all. Best decision I made moving to Baytown was joining the Chamber.
